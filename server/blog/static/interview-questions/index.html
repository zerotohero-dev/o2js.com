                <h2>Who This Book is for</h2>

                <p>Before I get into who this book <strong>is</strong> for, I guess
                I should tell you who this book <strong>isn't</strong> for:
                This book isn't for those looking for quick remedies. Nor is this
                book a <strong>magic wand</strong> that will instantly transform you
                into a rockstar candidate. It is <strong>not</strong> for the lazy,
                or for the close-minded, or for those who think that the overall job
                interview process is a "<strong>virtual reality</strong>" to keep
                you out anyway. This book <strong>isn't</strong> for those who have
                their minds made up, or know it all. As you will see, this book is
                a <strong>radical departure</strong> from virtually all other
                interview books available.</p>

                <p>This book <strong>is</strong> for people who live and breathe
                <strong>JavaScript</strong>. This book is for those who are
                <strong>bold enough</strong> to investigate the depth and breadth
                of <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Although the intended audience of
                this book is the <strong>curious</strong> people seeking for
                <strong>JavaScript Engineering</strong> jobs (<em>and obviously this
                book is highly <strong>JavaScript</strong>-focused</em>), anyone who
                wants ideas on how to <strong>ace</strong> in the technical and
                non-technical parts of an <strong>Engineering</strong> job interview
                process can benefit from this book. </p>

                <h2>&hellip; and is it for me?</h2>

                <blockquote>So just <strong>who is this book for?</strong> This book
                is for anyone who desires an improved <strong>perspective</strong>
                on <strong>JavaScript interviews</strong>, and who wants to leverage
                this new perspective on a consistent basis in the playing of the
                game of "<strong>virtual reality</strong>".</blockquote> 

                <p>This book is for those who understand the value and necessity of
                <strong>hard work</strong>, and are willing to put forth an effort
                to learn: This book will teach you lesser-known minute details on
                how to prepare for a <strong>technical interview</strong> in
                general, and how to prepare for a
                <strong>JavaScript Engineering</strong> interview in particular.
                And, as they say, "<strong>Devil is in the details</strong>".</p>
            </div>


            <div style="float:right;padding-right:30px;position:relative;top:-50px;">
                <h2>Take the <strong>Red Pill</strong></h2>

                <p>In the last couple of years I have been to at least
                <strong>a hundred</strong> technical interviews on
                <strong>JavaScript Engineering</strong>,
                <strong>Front-End Development</strong>, and related positions.
                So, rather than giving you some HR Manager’s perspective on what
                interviews should look like, I'm going to hand over you the
                <strong>red pill</strong> and tell what the
                <strong>JavaScript Engineering</strong> interviews
                <strong>really are</strong>, and what you will need to know to get
                the job you want.</p>

                <p>This book is for "<strong>doers</strong>"; not spectators or
                readers. This book is for <strong>believers</strong>, for those who
                instinctively say “yes that makes sense” and dive in right away.
                This book is also for <strong>skeptics</strong>, who may doubt the
                efficacy and value of the material, but are
                <strong>open-minded</strong> enough to begin and give things an
                honest chance.</p>

                <p>Contrary to most of the programming interview books on the
                market, this book will <strong>teach</strong> you
                <strong>how to think</strong>, instead of forcing you memorize a set
                of "<em>how do you balance an unbalanced binary tree?</em>"
                kind of questions. Rather, this book will show you all the most
                important features of <strong>JavaScript</strong> and how
                they <strong>fit together</strong>.</p>

                <p>Enough said; I'll <a href="https://gist.github.com/2694911"

                release ASAP. In the meantime, you can
                <strong>pre-order</strong> the book below and save.</p>

                <h2>Early Bird Specials</h2>

                <p>This book is for all the frustrated candidates who
                have been into a great interview, but haven't received the expected
                outcome (i.e. <strong>an offer</strong>) from the process. After you
                finish this book, you will have a
                <strong>solid foundation of knowledge</strong> that you can build
                upon to knock out <strong>any</strong> kind of interviewing
                challenge thrown over you.</p>

                <p>It will cost less than two cups of coffee, and it will be <strong>the

                    <p>We need more of these. There are a lot of books about interviews on the shelf,
                    but not many of them have the quality of "<strong>JavaScript Interview Questions</strong>" that I
                    can recommend that could be useful not only for the candidates, but also for the
                    decision-makers on the other side of the desk. I endorse the tremendous
                    effort that has been put into this book.

                    I found your book a vital resource for interview prep and overall JavaScript review.  It is a hidden gem and will soon be, 
                    if it is not already, a staple for the Web Development and Javascript Community.

                <p>I <strong>don't</strong> say it will be easy;
                and I <strong>don't</strong> say it will be quick.
                <strong>It's freaking hard work!</strong> If it were easy,
                everybody would have done it.</p>

                <p>But if you are <strong>persistent</strong>,
                <strong>stubborn</strong>, and <strong>ambitious</strong>
                enough, sooner than later you will reap the benefits
                of this book.</p>

                <p>If you want to work in a rock star company,
                <strong>be a rock star</strong>: Do your homework,
                don't just skim, but <strong>digest</strong> this book:
                Browse any links cited; read through any supporting materials
                given.</p>

                <p>If you investigate every single one of the
                <strong>tips</strong>, <strong>tricks</strong> and
                <strong>ideas</strong> presented in this book, all the places
                that you'd  admire to work at will be
