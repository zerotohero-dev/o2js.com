    <title>o2.js - A Coherent Solution to You JavaScript Dilemma | Upcoming News </title>

    <!--
    		Dear source code reader,

    		Thank you very much for diving in.

    		You are either stealing a CSS transition effect, or a layout feature on this page [1],
    		or you are someone interested in how I organize my markup [2].

    		For [1]:
    			Dude, go ahead use the code as if it's yours. I would appreciate if you
    			send me a "thank you e-mail" (to me@volkan.io), so that we can get in touch with
    			each other as two web professionals.

    		For [2]:
                 This is an ongoing "static blog" side project of mine.
                 It is open source, and you can see it at: <https://github.com/v0lkan/o2js.com>
                 Currently this blog's content and the generator code is intermingled.
                 That is, it's not a turn key solution.

                 I plan to make it a product, when I have time;
                 and until then you'll have to muddle your way through.

                Having said that, feel free to fork the code, and contribute to it if you like.

    		The layout is kind-of responsive; meaning: I did not spend a hell lot of time to
    		optimize the experience in mobile user agents. However the content is still readable,
    		and looks adequately decent in mobile browsers.

    		Oh and there's an option [3]: You are a decision-maker, or a rare breed of
    		recruiter with technical knowledge, and curiosity, wanting to "read the source"
    		before walking the talk. Well, then I am confident in my knowledge, skills, and
    		abilities; and my friends consider me a cunning hacker, and a fast learner.

        		I love hacking, and I love paying attention to seemingly invisible things.

    		At any rate, if you are interested enough to read the source, then we definitely
    		should touch base.

    		Oh... For the standardistas out there:

        		Last time I checked this document was valid HTML5 + ARIA + SVG 1.1 + MathML 2.0.

    		However, since those standards change regularly, and there still is debate between
    		organizations, and domain experts on things like how to semantically structure the
    		document, whether we should use H1 tags all around, or show sympathy to screen readers
    		and use H1..H6 tags as we had used before, etc...

    		I mean, I might not be doing the right thing, and I would love to have your ideas,
    		opinions, and suggestions about how to make this markup better.

    		I, myself, am a performance freak, so I'd truly appreciate any suggestion about
    		how to make this web page better, and faster.

    		With respect,
    		Volkan.

<h2 class="title span8"><a href="/upcoming-news">Upcoming News</a></h2>
<div class="span8">
  <p><a href="http://o2js.com/assets/mind_like_water_large.png"><img src="http://o2js.com/assets/mind_like_water.png" style="float:left;margin:2em;" alt="" title="Be like water; when you receive a pepple, give a 'pebble response'; when you receive a boulder, give a 'boulder response'; steadily evolve, while accepting and internalizing every experience you have on the road. — Because it’s the road that matters." /></a></p>
<p>Although I have not written recently, there’s a lot going on behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Everything is gradually morphing into a better state. </p>
<p>Since most of these are not (<em>yet</em>) publicly visible, I wanted to share the overall progress, along with my excitement, and passion.</p>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p>Here are a few things on the way.</p>
<h3>I&#39;m Turning <strong>o2js.com</strong> Into an Evergreen <strong>Ebook</strong></h3>
<p>This is one of my biggest works in progress. I’ve organized the content into sections and subsections as follows:</p>
<p><img src="http://o2js.com/assets/sections.png" alt="" title="Sections"></p>
<p>I will be adding more to this. </p>
<p>Basically, it will be a never-ending work, constantly updating itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since creating an <strong>ebook</strong> will be a serious effort, it “<strong>might</strong>” not be free — I am still thinking about the details.</p>
<p>I will also add <strong>special</strong> sections to the ebook that will not be on the web version, to justify its price tag.</p>
<p>By the way, the web version will <strong>always</strong> be free <strong>forever</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Moving <strong>o2.js</strong> Into Small And Reusable Modules</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The current trend is being small, modular, independent, pluggable, and reusable. </p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8243523" title="Discuss &quot;Yahoo! Stopping All Developent on YUI&quot; on hackernews.">Even <strong>Yahoo!</strong> ceased all new development on its monolithic <strong>YUI</strong> framework</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Via the same reasoning, I’ve logically split <strong>o2.js</strong> into <strong><a href="https://github.com/o2js" title="Visit o2.js on github.">24 smaller sub-modules</a></strong>, each of them will be independent of each other, and will be maintained in a separate repository.</p>
<h3>Some Wheel Reinvention Is Due</h3>
<p>We, human beings, learn by <strong>imitation</strong>.</p>
<p>Learning programming <strong>patterns</strong> and <strong>paradigms</strong> is no different:</p>
<ul>
<li>First you <strong>copy</strong> others’ code; </li>
<li>Then you think about how you can <strong>extend </strong>that code, and what you can do differently;</li>
<li>And eventually you come up with your own <strong>approach</strong>, and <strong>style</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are battle-tested solutions to almost any technical problem that you can imagine; however, creating things from scratch gives you a <strong>deeper understanding</strong> behind the magic about <strong>why</strong> things work the way they work. </p>
<h4>Curiosity Kills the Cat</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The insight you gain from the process is invaluable. I highly suggest you to regularly re-invent the wheel to expand your horizon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t get me wrong: If you are working on a real-life application, that will be used by a real audience, then <strong>re-use</strong> existing frameworks, libraries, and solutions as much as you can. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are learning new things, don’t fear to re-invent, fail, retry, break, and experiment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides, sometime you do need something minimalistic, just to solve a domain-specific problem, where creating a tiny module from scratch might be a feasible solution.</p>
<h4>New <strong>o2.js</strong> Modules</h4>
<p>Having said that, I’ll be working on quite a few re-usable modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>A basic <strong>string utilities</strong> module;</li>
<li>A browser-based <strong>dependency-resolution</strong> module (<em>like <strong><a href="http://requirejs.org/" title="require.js">require.js</a></strong>, yet much lightweight and simple</em>);</li>
<li>A <strong>converter</strong> that converts the server-side <strong><a href="http://nodejs.org/" title="Node.JS">CommonJS</a></strong> modules, into a format that the above module uses (<em>similar to what <strong><a href="http://browserify.org/" title="Browserify">browserify</a></strong> does, with less voodoo magic</em>);</li>
<li>A really simple <strong>unit testing</strong> library that integrates with <strong><a href="https://travis-ci.org/" title="Travis CI">Travis</a></strong>;</li>
<li>Make that unit testing solution test the modules that are supposed to run on the browser too, by mocking certain <strong>DOM</strong> interactions;</li>
<li>Create <strong>code coverage reports</strong> out of these unit tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these will also be the ingredients of quite a few articles, which I will be writing along the way.</p>
<h3>Stay Tuned <strong>;)</strong></h3>
<p>People who know me know that I’m <strong>always</strong> extremely busy with “things”. Which means that all of these aforementioned “reinvention”s will happen gradually, steadily, yet slowly.</p>
<p>Hope it will be a useful journey both for me, as well as for anyone who is passionate about creating, making, breaking, and <strong><a href="http://o2js.com/are-you-ready-to-hack" title="Who Else Is Ready to Hack?">hacking</a></strong> things.</p>
