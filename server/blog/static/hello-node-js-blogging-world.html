    <title>o2.js - A Coherent Solution to You JavaScript Dilemma | Hello Node.JS Blogging World </title>

    <!--
    		Dear source code reader,

    		Thank you very much for diving in.

    		You are either stealing a CSS transition effect, or a layout feature on this page [1],
    		or you are someone interested in how I organize my markup [2].

    		For [1]:
    			Dude, go ahead use the code as if it's yours. I would appreciate if you
    			send me a "thank you e-mail" (to me@volkan.io), so that we can get in touch with
    			each other as two web professionals.

    		For [2]:
                 This is an ongoing "static blog" side project of mine.
                 It is open source, and you can see it at: <https://github.com/v0lkan/o2js.com>
                 Currently this blog's content and the generator code is intermingled.
                 That is, it's not a turn key solution.

                 I plan to make it a product, when I have time;
                 and until then you'll have to muddle your way through.

                Having said that, feel free to fork the code, and contribute to it if you like.

    		The layout is kind-of responsive; meaning: I did not spend a hell lot of time to
    		optimize the experience in mobile user agents. However the content is still readable,
    		and looks adequately decent in mobile browsers.

    		Oh and there's an option [3]: You are a decision-maker, or a rare breed of
    		recruiter with technical knowledge, and curiosity, wanting to "read the source"
    		before walking the talk. Well, then I am confident in my knowledge, skills, and
    		abilities; and my friends consider me a cunning hacker, and a fast learner.

        		I love hacking, and I love paying attention to seemingly invisible things.

    		At any rate, if you are interested enough to read the source, then we definitely
    		should touch base.

    		Oh... For the standardistas out there:

        		Last time I checked this document was valid HTML5 + ARIA + SVG 1.1 + MathML 2.0.

    		However, since those standards change regularly, and there still is debate between
    		organizations, and domain experts on things like how to semantically structure the
    		document, whether we should use H1 tags all around, or show sympathy to screen readers
    		and use H1..H6 tags as we had used before, etc...

    		I mean, I might not be doing the right thing, and I would love to have your ideas,
    		opinions, and suggestions about how to make this markup better.

    		I, myself, am a performance freak, so I'd truly appreciate any suggestion about
    		how to make this web page better, and faster.

    		With respect,
    		Volkan.

<h2 class="title span8"><a href="/hello-node-js-blogging-world">Hello Node.JS Blogging World</a></h2>
<div class="span8">
  <h3>What?</h3>
<p>This is the initial step of my <em>very-long-term</em> plan of <em>converting</em>/<em>porting</em> all of my sites and projects to a <strong>MongoDB/Markdown/NGINX/Node.JS</strong> stack.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Because <strong><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a></strong> is one of the best <strong>NoSQL</strong> document stores;</li>
<li>Because <strong><a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">NGINX</a></strong> is the fastest and the most scalable server on earth;</li>
<li>Because <strong><a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a></strong> is cool (<em>and it&#39;s damn fast, too</em>);</li>
<li>Because <strong><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a></strong> enables you to write stuff without thinking about formatting. <strong>Markdown</strong> is crisp, clean, and readable.</li>
</ul>
<p>See it for yourself. Doesn&#39;t the following <strong>Markdown</strong> image of this blog post simply look beautiful?:</p>
<p><a href="http://o2js.com/assets/markdown.png"><img src="http://o2js.com/assets/markdownsm.png" alt="Markdown screenshot"></a></p>
<p>Editing a <strong>Markdown</strong> document is way better than fighting your way through your &quot;<em>what you see is what you don&#39;t always get</em>&quot; rich text editor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It sucks to realize that your beloved editor has decided to &quot;<em>cleverly</em>&quot; format &quot;<em>your</em>&quot; text behind your back.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Setup</h3>
<p>This site has been created with <strong><a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a></strong>, exported to a static site using <strong>Node.JS</strong> and is currently <em>reverse-proxied</em> to an <strong><a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">NGINX</a></strong> server through <strong><a href="http://www.iis.net/">IIS 7</a></strong>.</p>
<p>I know, it&#39;s more complicated than it should be. And I have my reasons. I will write about the specifics of <em>how I did that</em>, in a follow-up post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, btw., this blog is really minimaslistic: It does not have a <em>comment</em> feature <strong>yet</strong>. So <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/linkibol/">feel free to tweet me</a></strong>, if you have comments, or questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>For God&#39;s Sake; Why <strong>IIS</strong>?!</h4>
<p>I need <strong><a href="http://www.iis.net/">IIS 7</a></strong> for a transitional period. Otherwise I will have to rent another server, maintain two servers simultaneously, setup DNS for the new server. It&#39;s not worth the hassle.</p>
<p>I have a dedicated Windows Server anyways, and I have <strong>8 CPU cores</strong> and <strong>plenty of idle memory</strong>. So creating a virtual server and proxying/port-forwarding requests to this server is a plausible option.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I could have done the other way around: i.e. I could have rented a dedicated linux server; run a virtual windows box in it; configured <strong>IIS</strong>; created an <strong>SMTP</strong> server; setup <strong>PHP</strong>; imported all the sites; imported databases; reconfigured <strong>mySQL</strong> (<em>my.ini</em>); configured other tools that I use occasionally (<em>like a jabber server</em>)… and the like – And it would have been <strong>a lot of redundant work</strong> for a server that I would be dumping in the long run, anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes a virtual box has a <strong>minor</strong> performance overhead; and it has its benefits, too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I&#39;m playing with a brand new environment, it&#39;s possible that I may mess things up. With a virtual server, I can take a snapshot of the entire system before I feel  &quot;<em>experimental</em>&quot;, hack around, and restore back to my stable snapshot if things do not go well.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>My Action Plan</h3>
<p>As I said, <strong>this is a very long-term project</strong>. And there is a long list of things to do. Some are easy, and some will consume a lot of time.</p>
<p>Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moving My Technical Blog <a href="http://o2js.com/">o2js.com</a></strong> – I will transfer posts from <em>o2js.com</em> blog to this new blog. I will start with the most popular ones first. I will also be <strong>editing</strong> and <strong>ehnancing</strong> the copied posts along the way. – This will result in a better blog, with up-to-date content to reflect contemporary patterns and practices in <strong>Front End Web Application Architecture</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Moving Other Blogs that I Have</strong> – There are quality content that I authored in other places, too (like <strong><a href="http://blog.linkibol.com/">blog.linkibol.com</a></strong>). – I will move those content to this new blog as well.</li>
<li><strong>Moving Other Peoples&#39; Sites</strong> – Sites that I don&#39;t directly have control over (<em>the sites that belong to friends, and family, which are hosted on my server, and are mostly in </em>php* <em>) – Well, guess what? <strong>linux</strong> can run </em>PHP* too <strong>;)</strong>. So I will transfer them directly to vm, and start serving them there.</li>
<li><strong>Moving My Portfolio Site <a href="http://volkan.io/">volkan.io</a></strong> – since it&#39;s a static single page. I will be rewriting it anyway, so moving it to the linux vm is not a big deal.</li>
<li><strong>Importing Data</strong> – This will be an issue I&#39;d have to deal when the time comes.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance / Scheduling Backups</strong> – Since the server will be a production server eventually, I have to make sure that I don&#39;t lose valuable info.</li>
<li>… there are probably other things that I&#39;m not taking into account right now; and I will be dealing with them, one by one, as they come.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What About <a href="http://linkibol.com/">linkibol.com</a>?</h3>
<p>Back in 2003, I created a social bookmarking site <a href="http://linkibol.com/">linkibol.com</a>, which is still getting a lot of traffic. This will be the hardest project to transfer to this <strong>Linux</strong> box, since it has a lot of moving parts and dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="http://linkibol.com/">linkibol.com</a> is <em>the elephant in the room</em>. And honestly, it&#39;s the only reason I&#39;m still using a dedicated windows box. It&#39;s a giant that devours most of my server&#39;s resources. And it&#39;s an <strong>ASP.net/C#</strong> project. That&#39;s why I need <strong>IIS</strong> and a <strong>windows server</strong> to run it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While developing <a href="http://linkibol.com/">linkibol.com</a> I&#39;ve learned a hell lot of things about <strong>social bookmarking</strong>, <strong>social networks</strong>, <strong>caching</strong>, <strong>degrees of separation</strong>, <strong>scalability</strong>, <strong>graph theory</strong>, <strong>popularity algorithms</strong>, <strong>bayesian statistics</strong>, and more…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the site had not received massive attention from the Turkish internet community, I would not have been forced to optimize every single bit of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, I believe it&#39;s time to pay back to community by sharing what I&#39;ve learned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/v0lkan/linkibol">I&#39;ve already started an open source project on github</a>. I will be  rewriting <strong>linkibol.com</strong> from scratch using <strong>Node.JS</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong>. And it will take a <strong>loooooong</strong> time to complete.</p>
<p>So if any of you guys are interested, <a href="https://github.com/v0lkan/linkibol/issues">I&#39;d love to have your help</a>.</p>
<h3>Next Up?</h3>
<p>So how did I set everything up? What is my current configuration?</p>
<p>This is the topic of the <a href="http://o2js.com/the-setup">next blog post</a>.</p>
